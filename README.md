# Welcome to My Vivino
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Task
My Vivino is an online marketplace. We have a vast wine database, and we have 27 million users, mainly in North America. One of our leading services is a wine recommendation system. It starts to be a little old. Rules-based. We are selling wine based on our customer visit/research. Data science is the future, and our competitor my_wine.com has invested a lot in it.

# Description
We have to make a recommendation system to My Vivino marketplace.

# Installation
We have installed seaborn and scikit-learn libraries

# Usage
./my_project.py
